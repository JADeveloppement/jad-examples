## About JADeveloppement

My name is Jalal AISSAOUI, and I am a self-taught fullstack web developper. In this repository, you'll find the source to my page "Examples" of all projects I already did since I began coding my first webpage.
I am actually updating all my old project to fit the current changes and it allows me to train myself with everything I already know and allows me to update my knowledges and better my practice.
